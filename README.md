**security bounty**

This programm utelizes AES + some magic to encrypt folders, with a user-set password.
I'm not aware of any security downfalls of my approach used here.

**I'll give 300euro price money to anyone who is able to crack the example.tvault.encrypted file and provide me the flag inside**  ( personal attacks / illegal approaches are not tollerated and will be reported )

> if you find other security concerns / issues with this also [notify me](herrduenschnlate+tvault@gmail.com) and i'll look into it
